## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: Green (#4caf50), conveying a fresh and accessible feel, appropriate for a campus environment.
- Background color: Beige (#faf8f3), providing a soft and clean backdrop that complements the green.
- Secondary color: Gray (#a3a19c), used for text and subtle UI elements to provide contrast without overwhelming the design.
- Accent color: Black (#121212), reserved for important text, icons, and interactive elements to draw attention.
- Body and headline font: 'PT Sans', sans-serif for a modern yet accessible feel, suitable for both headlines and body text. Note: currently only Google Fonts are supported.
- Design a responsive layout prioritizing mobile users with a fixed bottom navigation bar for easy access to core features.
- Employ recognizable icons within the navigation bar and throughout the interface, maintaining consistency in style.
- Incorporate subtle transitions when navigating between pages and updating order statuses to provide visual feedback and enhance user experience.
